# Media Queue
Book and TV Show backlog app written in Flutter

Demo application using [Flutter](https://flutter.io).
Media Queue is a simple application to track books to 
be read and TV shows to be watched. It has a "TODO" list style interface with multiple tabs (one for books and one for shows).
Items within the list can be reordered, deleted (with a long press), or completed. 

### Technical Features
* sqlite backed storage of media items
* tabbed interface
* reorderable list view (all credit for that goes to [knopp](https://github.com/knopp/flutter_reorderable_list))

### Future
* I'd like to add barcode scanning and UPC lookups for adding books to the queue.
* Add Thumbnails/Images for items that have been looked up
* dialog for confirming deletes
* general styling and theme implementation
